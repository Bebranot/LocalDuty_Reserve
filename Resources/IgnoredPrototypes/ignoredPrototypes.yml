# This is a basic list that specifies files for which the prototypes inside of them will be made abstract.
# This supports all prototype kinds and is intended to allow servers to remove prototypes in a relatively clean way.
# This method does not break inheritance, but you will still have to remove usages.

# e.g., you can specify both directories and specific files by adding lines like:
#
# - /Prototypes/Guidebook
# - /Prototypes/Catalog/uplink_catalog.yml

# Reserve edit - Reserve guidebook begin
# Prototypes below are translated and replaced by copies. We ignore them so they won't appear in guidebook
# If you do translate some pages further - consider adding original version here.
